File nomenclature:

plotBurstData0.m -- plots raster plot of network activity
CCyPlot.m -- plot successive evolution of cummulative curves
tempSynEE0a.m -- Plots synaptic distribution within evolved excitatory network
ConnectTopologyEE0.m -- plots synapses among neurons rich with outgoing and incomming synapses
tempSynIE0b.m -- Plots synaptic distribution within evolved composite network
jetplot.m -- a function file used by tempSynEE0a.m, ConnectTopologyEE0.m and tempSynIE0b.m


Folder nomenclature:

IsoNeuronActivity -- contains simulated data files corresponding to synaptically isolated activity of network neurons at two different g_tonic values
			(g_tonic = 0.10 and g_tonic = 0.34)

DataSet0 -- contains simulated data files for evolution of excitatory network
DataSet1 -- contains simulated data files for evolution of composite network
